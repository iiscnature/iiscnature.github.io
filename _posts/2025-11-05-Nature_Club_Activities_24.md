The **IISc Nature Club** is a vibrant community of students and campus residents who deeply care about our natural surroundings and the diverse inhabitants within them. 

Situated within the rapidly evolving urban landscape of Bangalore, the biodiverse campus of IISc serves as a vital ecological sanctuary. We have been organizing nature walks, workshops, and treks both within the campus and across the region for several years. Our expert-led walks explore everything from mushrooms and trees to insects, birds, and the elusive slender loris. 

Through these activities, we aim to spark curiosity while spreading awareness and appreciation for the rich biodiversity we share our space with.

## Activity Highlights (Sept '24 – Aug '25)
