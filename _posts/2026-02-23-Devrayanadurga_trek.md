The **IISc Nature Club** kicked off the new year with an early morning trek to **Devarayana Durga** on January 10th. Organized by **Naman**, the group explored a rugged jungle trail that showcased the local landscape.

## Trek Highlights

* **The Journey:** We departed IISc at 3:30 AM with a group of 43 participants.
* **The Route:** We took a "V-shaped" route, entering from one side and exiting at a different location where our bus met us.
* **Timeline:** Arriving at 5:30 AM and after some unforseen delays, we began the trek at 8:00 AM.
* **Duration:** The hike took around 2 hours to complete.
* **Terrain:** A relatiely gentle ascent through dry deciduous forest leading to a vast rocky plateau.
